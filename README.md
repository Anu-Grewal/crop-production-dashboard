# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Production in India Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize crop production data across different states in India. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of agricultural output, providing key insights into production trends, state-wise performance, and crop-specific data.

## Dashboard Features

### 1. **Total Production Overview**
   - **Total Production:** 141 billion units
   - **Total Area:** 2.95 billion hectares
   - **Average Yield per Hectare:** 47.87 units

### 2. **Production by Geography**
   - **State-wise Production:** Visual representation of total crop production across various Indian states, with Kerala leading in production.
   - **City-wise Production:** Insight into production distribution at the city level, mapped geographically to highlight areas of high output.

### 3. **Production by Crop Type**
   - **Crop-Specific Production:** Displays production data for different crops, including Rice, Wheat, Cotton (lint), Bajra, and Jowar, with Rice being the highest produced crop.
   - **Total Area by Crop:** A breakdown of the area under cultivation for each crop, providing insights into the scale of production.

### 4. **Seasonal Analysis**
   - **Production by Season:** Analysis of crop production distributed across various seasons, including Kharif, Rabi, Whole Year, Winter, and Summer. Kharif season shows the highest production.
   - **Area by Season:** A visualization of the area cultivated in different seasons, helping to understand the agricultural patterns.

### 5. **Yearly Production Trends**
   - **Production by Year:** A bar chart showing the sum of production over the years, allowing for the identification of trends and changes in agricultural output over time.

## Usage

This dashboard is built using Power BI and is particularly useful for agricultural analysts, policymakers, and researchers who need to understand the dynamics of crop production in India. It can aid in making informed decisions related to agricultural planning, resource allocation, and policy formulation.

## Data Source

The data used to create this dashboard is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/statewise-crop-production-in-india-a-statistical). It includes detailed statistics on crop production, area cultivated, and yield across different states and seasons in India.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the dashboard to gain insights into crop production patterns across India.
4. Utilize the filters and slicers to customize the view according to different crops, states, seasons, or years.

## Visualizations

The dashboard features a variety of visualizations, including:
- Bar charts for yearly production trends.
- Pie charts for production by season and area by season.
- Line charts for production by crop and state.
- Geographical maps for state-wise and city-wise production.
- KPIs and cards for key metrics.
